# Architecture Summary

## Files Created

### 1. `/docs/architecture.md`
**Comprehensive system architecture documentation including:**
- System architecture diagram (ASCII art)
- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- Data flow between components
- API client design with retry logic and rate limiting
- Conversion pipeline stages
- Database transformation architecture
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- Performance considerations
- Security architecture
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and observability
- Future extensibility plans

### 2. `/src/types/index.ts`
**Core type definitions (2,000+ lines) covering:**
- Application configuration types
- Notion API types (pages, databases, blocks, properties)
- Obsidian vault and file types
- Conversion pipeline types
- Database conversion types
- Content processing types
- Error handling types
- Progress tracking types
- Workspace and context types
- Utility types and constants

### 3. `/src/types/components.ts`
**Component interface definitions implementing hexagonal architecture:**
- Core application interfaces (ImportOrchestrator, WorkspaceManager)
- API and data access interfaces (NotionRepository, FileSystemAdapter)
- Conversion interfaces (ConverterFactory, PageConverter, BlockConverter)
- Link and relationship management interfaces
- Validation and quality assurance interfaces
- Plugin and extension interfaces
- Configuration and settings management interfaces
- Supporting type definitions

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Hexagonal Architecture**
- Clean separation between core business logic and external dependencies
- Dependency inversion principle enforced through interfaces
- Pluggable adapters for different services (API, file system, cache)

### 2. **Rate-Limited API Client**
- 3 requests/second limit with burst capability
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Circuit breaker pattern for reliability
- Request queue with deduplication

### 3. **Database to Bases Conversion**
- Comprehensive property type mapping system
- Relationship preservation through bidirectional links
- Index generation for complex queries
- Folder-based organization with customizable strategies

### 4. **Error Recovery System**
- Checkpoint-based recovery
- Multiple retry strategies by error type
- Partial recovery capabilities
- Comprehensive logging and audit trail

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- Intelligent caching at multiple levels
- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Memory management for large workspaces

### 6. **Extensibility Framework**
- Plugin system for custom converters
- Hook-based event system
- Configuration override hierarchy
- Custom transformation pipelines

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Core Infrastructure** - Implement basic API client and file system adapters
2. **Conversion Pipeline** - Build the core conversion stages
3. **Database Converter** - Implement property mapping and relationship handling
4. **Error Handling** - Implement recovery mechanisms and retry logic
5. **Progress Tracking** - Build monitoring and progress reporting
6. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test suite for all components
7. **CLI Interface** - User-friendly command-line interface
8. **Documentation** - User guides and API documentation

The architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable Notion-to-Obsidian importer with comprehensive database conversion capabilities.
