# Feature Specification: Rehab Exercise Tracking Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-rehab-exercise-tracking`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Awesome  here's the tight one-pager spec plus a minimal Elixir/OTP skeleton you can hand to a teammate and extend module-by-module without touching the core. Rehab Exercise Tracking Core - Event-sourced system for physical therapists to monitor home exercise quality and adherence with minimal workflow overhead"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Physical therapist monitoring system for patient exercise tracking
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: physical therapists, patients
   � Actions: monitor, track, provide feedback
   � Data: exercise sessions, quality metrics, adherence data
   � Constraints: minimal workflow overhead, event-sourced architecture
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Alert thresholds for therapist intervention marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Patient-therapist workflow clearly defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement mapped to business value
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Events, patients, exercises, sessions, feedback
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All sections completed, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Physical therapists need to monitor their patients' home exercise quality and adherence without increasing their administrative workload. Patients perform prescribed exercises at home, with the system capturing exercise quality data and alerting therapists when intervention is needed. Therapists receive digestible reports showing patient progress and can provide targeted feedback based on objective data rather than patient self-reporting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a patient has been prescribed home exercises, **When** they perform exercises at home, **Then** the system captures rep-by-rep quality data and session completion
2. **Given** a patient consistently performs exercises below quality threshold, **When** the system detects this pattern, **Then** it alerts the therapist within 24 hours
3. **Given** a therapist reviews patient data, **When** they access the patient's exercise history, **Then** they see adherence percentages, quality trends, and specific areas needing attention
4. **Given** a patient misses exercise sessions for multiple days, **When** the absence pattern triggers alert criteria, **Then** the therapist receives a notification with context about the missed sessions
5. **Given** a therapist wants to provide feedback, **When** they review a patient's exercise data, **Then** they can send targeted guidance based on specific quality observations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when exercise capture system fails during a session?
- How does system handle patients who perform exercises outside prescribed parameters?
- What alerts are generated for patients who consistently exceed expected performance?
- How does the system differentiate between equipment issues and patient form issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture individual repetition quality scores during exercise sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST track daily exercise session completion rates per patient
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate adherence metrics as 7-day rolling averages
- **FR-004**: System MUST alert therapists when patient quality scores fall below 0.70 average over 7 days OR when 30% of reps show critical issues
- **FR-005**: System MUST alert therapists when patients miss exercises for 2 consecutive days OR complete less than 50% of prescribed sessions over a week
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain audit trail of all patient exercise data for compliance
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow therapists to provide feedback notes linked to specific exercise sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve patient privacy by flagging PHI data appropriately
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple exercise types with different quality criteria
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate work queues for therapists prioritized by urgency
- **FR-011**: System MUST track alert response times and resolution status
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow patients to provide session feedback and notes
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle patient consent management for data collection and retention
- **FR-014**: System MUST export structured summary data ready for standard EMR integration (platform-neutral format supporting FHIR/HL7)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide therapists with quality trend analysis over 14-day and 28-day windows

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Exercise Session**: Represents a complete patient exercise period with start/end times, completion status, and overall quality assessment
- **Rep Observation**: Individual repetition data including quality score, confidence rating, and specific form feedback reasons
- **Patient**: Subject performing exercises with unique identifier and associated consent/privacy settings
- **Exercise Definition**: Template defining valid movements, constraints, and scoring criteria for specific therapeutic exercises
- **Alert**: Triage-worthy notification for therapist attention with urgency level and context
- **Therapist Feedback**: Professional guidance and notes linked to specific sessions or patterns
- **Consent Record**: Patient authorization scope for data collection, retention periods, and usage permissions
- **Quality Projection**: Aggregated view of patient performance trends and adherence metrics
- **Work Queue Item**: Prioritized task for therapist review with SLA tracking
