## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Slack Clone, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid putting users at risk.

### 2. Report via Email

Send a detailed report to **security@yourdomain.com** with:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. Report Format

Please use the following template:

```
**Summary:** Brief description of the vulnerability

**Affected Components:** Which parts of the application are affected

**Attack Vector:** How the vulnerability can be exploited

**Impact:** What an attacker could achieve

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. etc.

**Proposed Solution:** (Optional) Your suggested fix

**Additional Context:** Any other relevant information
```

### 4. Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial response acknowledging receipt
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Regular updates on investigation progress
- **30 days**: Expected resolution timeline (varies by complexity)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries via Ecto
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Phoenix CSRF tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: API and authentication rate limiting
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all connections
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers via Plug
- **Session Security**: Secure cookie settings
- **Password Security**: Argon2 password hashing

### Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Automated security updates via Dependabot
   - Regular security audits with `mix deps.audit`

2. **Environment Security**
   - All secrets stored in environment variables
   - No hardcoded credentials in code
   - Separate environments for dev/staging/prod

3. **Database Security**
   - Encrypted database connections
   - Database user with minimal privileges
   - Regular database backups with encryption

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Security event logging
   - Failed authentication monitoring
   - Anomaly detection

## Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning tools:

- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Weekly dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Semgrep**: Additional security-focused code scanning
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of accidentally committed secrets

## Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers to resolve vulnerabilities responsibly:

1. **Confidentiality**: We will not share your report with third parties without your permission
2. **Attribution**: We will acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer anonymity)
3. **Timeline**: We aim to resolve issues within 90 days of confirmed reports
4. **Coordination**: We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you

## Security Champions Program

Researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities may be eligible for:

- Public acknowledgment in our security advisories
- Invitation to our private security researchers group
- Early access to beta features for security testing

## Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@yourdomain.com
- **Security Lead**: security-lead@yourdomain.com
- **PGP Key**: [Link to public PGP key for encrypted communication]
