  case Guardian.decode_and_verify(token) do
    {:ok, claims} ->
      case Guardian.resource_from_claims(claims) do
        {:ok, user} ->
          socket = assign(socket, :user_id, user.id)
          {:ok, socket}
        {:error, _reason} -> :error
      end
    {:error, _reason} -> :error
  end
end
```

**Channel Architecture**:
- **WorkspaceChannel** (276 lines): Enterprise-grade workspace management
